In this project a model was built using demographic data including median age, home value, income, as well as percent of homes lived in by owner and enviornmental data referencing amount of solar radiation for each zip code in the model with the intent of identifying zip codes where the population had a higher rate of solar panels per capita than the rest of the country, thus ideally identifying markets where the sale of solar panels would be easier than others.

The map that also plots the training data is too complex for githubs html previewer, feel free to download and zoom if you have a good computer.  Image of map below.
